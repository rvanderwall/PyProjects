<font color="red">Updated: 25th April 2020, 03:07 BST <B>All graphs
    have been updated, but only some of the commentary. I've added
    graphs comparing the death rate in the North East US region to EU
    countries.

<P>In general, many countries are showing signs of having peaked
(number of new confirmed cases per day is now decreasing), and several
are now showing signs that the death rate has also peaked. The path down from the peak is often not smooth and a number of countries have seen case numbers rebound one of more times after the peak.  MJH</B></font>
<P>
This page presents historical SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
information.  I try to present it in a way that helps inform about how
the virus is progressing throughout the main outbreaks worldwide in a
way that allows countries to be compared and perhaps lessons learned.
The underlying infection and containment processes are complicated,
and conclusions you or I may draw from these graphs are not true
predictions.  For that, you'd need much more data about what is being
done in each country, and about how the data is collected. Comments
are my interpretation only.  Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.

<LI>The graph shows <B>cumulative number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a log
scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the
amounts shown. </LI>
<LI>Certain increase rates: 35%, 22%, 13.5% and 8% really stand out in
  the data, as each country has settled on these rates for a while at
  different phases of the epidemic. I don't have any good
  justification for why these specific increase rates exist as strong
  features of the data, but they do appear to be quite prominent at
  the relative phases of the epidemic.  Likely they are related to
  various levels of social distancing performed by these countries.

<LI>35% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 2.5 days</LI>

<LI>8% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 9 days</LI>
</UL>

<LI>On this graph I show the confirmed cases for Western European
countries, with the curves aligned at the point when each had just
transitioned from 35% daily increases to 22% daily increases.  This
view highlights the differences between countries, but is less useful
than <a href="#covid-eu-norm">the next graph</a> for understanding
similarities, so I will reserve discussion of the individual curves for
that graph.

<LI>8% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 9 days</LI>
</UL>

<LI> In contrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, <B>on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 8% curve</B> as that is the last common exponential rate that these countries all seem to have followed.  I'm also showing a shorter time interval.

<LI>Italy followed the 8% curve for about five days before
peaking. Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the
daily increase count appears to have peaked, though it has not declined greatly..

<LI> France peaked on March 31st with 7578 new cases that day.  Since
then new cases have declined to around 2000 cases per day, though
individual days have been significantly lower or higher.

<LI>Germany peaked twice with the second peak on April 3rd.  New cases
are now lower than 30% of the peak and declining.

<LI>For a long time the UK followed the French curve about one week
behind.  For the last ten days the UK has tracked higher than France,
Cases peaked on April 11th, but have not declined as fast as France
did.  In part this may be due to a change in testing strategy.  Prior
to April 10th, only hospitalized patients ended up in the confirmed
test results.  As of April 21st, 35% of new cases were not
hospitalized patients.  This change accounts for almost all of the
difference between the current UK track and the French track.

<LI> The Netherlands appears to have been holding a roughly constant
daily increase rate for three weeks, with multiple similar peaks of
1172 cases on March 27th, 1083 cases on April 2nd, 1335 cases on April
10th and 1235 cases on April 17th.  This very broad peak may be due to
the Netherlands adopting relatively mild containment measures compared
to neighbouring countries.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown with no time offset to Italy.  
    
<LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a> for
  why I am not confident in this placement for Switzerland. From that
  graph Switzerland looks to be as much as 10 days behind Italy.

<LI> Switzerland also saw multiple peaks, with 1481 cases on March
  20th, 1447 cases on March 27th, and 1128 cases on April 2nd.  Since
  then cases have declined to around 30% of the peak.
    
<LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any other
  large European country, which caused it to close on Italy, then
  followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned with
  the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the point
  where Italy departed it.  Spain saw peaks of 9372 cases on March
  27th, 10724 cases on March 31st, with smaller peaks of 6278 cases on
  April 8th and 6599 cases on April 15th.  New cases are currently at
  about 40% of the peak.

<LI>Austria followed the Lombardy curve pretty faithfully about ten
  days behind, staying at a higher increase rate for longer than
  Italy.  Austria peaked at 992 cases per day on March 27th and,
  unlike Italy, Austria has seen a fast decrease in new cases since,
  to around 60 cases per day now..

  A Holt-Winters moving average filter with constants &alpha;=0.5 and
  &beta;=0.5 has been applied to smooth the curves as differences are
  very noisy.  This is a moderate amount of smoothing and it imposes a
  about a days lag, but it does extract trends fairly well.  The
  curves are not offset, today is Day 0 for all curves.</LI>
<LI>On this graph I show some of the earlier countries that peaked,
and I have aligned the day they peaked at day 0.  Although the
logscale makes it hard to see how far cases have declined, it allows
us to see both the height of the peaks and the time taken to decline
on the same graph.  

<LI>It doesn't really make sense to show Chinese cases per million
inhabitants, when 82% of the cases were in Hubei province.  I have
therefore used the Hubei population as the China population when
calculating cases per million inhabitants.  Really all I care about on
this graph is the shape of the curve.

<LI>It is notable that China and Korea rose faster to their peaks and
declined faster from their peaks than western countries.

<LI>Italy's peak appears to be rather broad.  In part this may be due
to a large increase in testing just after the time of the peak, which
might give the impression cases are not falling as fast as they really
are.

  very noisy.  This is a moderate amount of smoothing and it imposes a
  about a days lag, but it does extract trends fairly well.  The
  curves are not offset, today is Day 0 for all curves.</LI>

<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better to
see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Confirmed cases in Spain, Germany and France have all peaked. It is not yet completely clear if they have peaked in the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and the UK, though all look like they may have peaked.

<LI>The UK is now reporting two sets of statistics.  The first
includes all confirmed cases, including a new testing programme for
healthcare workers and families.  These counts were not previously
included in the data.  The second count, so called "pillar 1"
statistics covers hospitalized patients, and is generally comparible
over time, even if it does not include all confirmed cases.  The UK
looks to have peaked on April 5th based on pillar 1 data, though the
full confirmed cases count does not show this peak due to the change
in testing methodology.

<LI>Ireland is showing a large increase in cases four days ago.  If I
understand correctly, this is due to the inclusion in the statistics
of a batch of much older test results which had been sent to Germany
for testing, and does not represent a real sudden increase in
infections.  Taking this into account, it looks like Ireland may also
be peaking.

<LI>The US is not technically in Western Europe, but I've added it here to aid comparison. 

<LI>The very rapid increase rate in the US appears to have tailed off,
but I suspect it has some way to go before peaking.  As the epidemic
is at different stages in different states, the US curve is less
likely to show a sharp peak when it does occur.  The last two weeks of
the US curve show strong similarities to the equivalent phase of the
Italian curve.

<LI>The graph shows <B>daily increase in confirmed cases normalized so the peaks of different countries are all the same height</B>, plotted on a linear scale against time.  A
  Holt-Winters moving average filter with constants &alpha;=0.5 and
  &beta;=0.5 has been applied to smooth the curves as differences are
  very noisy.  This is a moderate amount of smoothing and extracts trends fairly well without smoothing large peaks. </LI>
<LI>This linear-scale graph shows better than the log-scale graphs how
rapidly (or otherwise) cases drop off after the peak.  I've aligned
all the peaks together, and normalized the daily increases so the day
of maximum increase (after moderate smoothing) has value 1.  Where a
country had more than one peak within 90% of the same height, I've
aligned by the first one, as I'm interested in what happens once the
number of daily confirmed cases stops increasing.

<LI>Where a country essentially had a single outbreak, such as in
China or South Korea, once the outbreak is tackled effectively, the
cases can largely die back down within ten days of the peak.  But few
countries manage to achieve this, and double or triple peaks are
common.  There are likely to be a number of reasons for this ranging
from multiple outbreaks within a country peaking at different times to
mitigation measures not being completely effective.

As far as I can tell, the death statistics on this graph are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Italy: mostly does not include people who died outside hospitals. 

<LI>Spain: mostly does not include nursing homes, as only includes confirmed cases, and <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/madrid/2020-04-08/4750-ancianos-mueren-en-las-residencias-de-madrid-en-el-ultimo-mes.html">most nursing home deaths were not tested</a>.

<LI>France: does include nursing homes - as of 14th April, 29% of deaths occurred in nursing homes

<LI>UK: does not include nursing homes - as of 3rd April, likely somewhere between 18% and 34% where not in the original daily gov.uk statistics, likely meaning they occurred outside hospitals.  Data is only available up til 3rd April because deaths outside hospitals take time to be registered.  In Scotland, only <a href="https://t.co/vMerWdgadS?amp=1">62% of deaths were in hospitals</a>.

<LI>Belgium: does include nursing homes - as of 12th April, <a
href="https://epidemio.wiv-isp.be/ID/Pages/2019-nCoV_epidemiological_situation.aspx?lcid=1036">42%
of deaths</a> occured in nursing homes

<LI>Germany does include deaths that occur outside of hospitals,
including in nursing homes.  Every person who was infected with
COVID-19 and died is reported irrespective of whether COVID-19 was
the cause of death. Source: private email.

<LI>Netherlands: <a
href="https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/current-information-about-novel-coronavirus-covid-19">appears
to only include hospital deaths</a>.  My understanding is that only
confirmed positive patients are counted as COVID-19 deaths, and that
testing is mostly happening in hospitals, so deaths elsewhere are not
confirmed. Source: private email.

<LI>Ireland: includes nursing homes.  As of 14th April, <a
href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0414/1130463-irish-virus-figures/">46%
of deaths</a> occurred in nursing homes.

<LI>Norway: records all deaths, whether in hospitals, nursing homes or
at home.  Less than half of COVID-19 deaths in Norway were in hospitals.

<LI>Sweden: does include nursing homes.  in Stockholm (where most cases are) nursing homes or
care homes account for 40% of all deaths. 
</UL>

<LI>However they are being reported, if the reporting is consistent
(for example, only reporting hospital deaths) then we can at least
tell how fast deaths are rising or declining.  For this purpose, what
we really need is a fast and consistent count of deaths, even if it
misses half of deaths, than for a complete but delayed count, as this
lets us know what measures are working.  For other purposes, you
obviously want the comoplete count, but that takes a lot more
time to compile.

<LI>Comparing which country has the highest death count is not the
purpose of this graph: if you read it that way you will draw the wrong
conclusions: this is not a competition, and no-one can say the final
death rates until much later, if ever.




</LI>
    <LI> As different countries have different testing policies, many
      people have suggested that we should look at deaths instead.
      There are several downsides to using deaths as a metric.  First,
      if the purpose of these graphs is to provide warning of what is
      to come, or to verify whether measure are working, deaths is not
      very useful.  Death rate is too low to provide a warning signal
      in advance of there being a problem, and it is not a good early
      indicator of whether measures are working because it lags case
      data by between one and two weeks.  It can, however, provide
      some insight into what fraction of infections are being detected
      in different countries.  Generally, if a country is further
      behind in this graph than in the equivalent cases graph, then
      the country is probably catching a larger fraction of cases.
      This is particularly pronounced in the case of Germany.
    <LI>
      Death data is also problematic because deaths per day does not
      go down quickly when cases go down.  This is particularly clear
      in the Korean data, where the death rate has remained nearly
      constant for three weeks after new infections peaked.
    <LI>
      Finally, when a healthcare system gets overwhelmed, death rate
      goes up from something like 0.9% (Korea) to something like 3-4%
      (Hubei, parts of Lombardy).
    <LI>
      Generally when cases are increasing exponentially, most
      countries' death rate curves shadow the cases curve, with a lag
      of between 6 (France, UK) and 12 days (Germany).  Spain, France,
      Netherlands and the UK look very similar to how they looked using
      case data around 6 days ago.  Germany and Austria are about ten days further
      back on this graph.  The difference in
      per-capita testing rates does not seem to explain this
      difference.

<LI>In the last few days, the UK and France have seen more deaths than
Italy did at a similar point in the epidemic, whereas the Netherlands
and Switzerland have see fewer deaths and Austria and Germany have
significantly lower death rates.  However, any differences in reported
data between France, UK, Italy and the Netherlands are less than
possible differences due to <I>which</I> deaths are included in the statistics,
so these statistics cannot be used to rank countries like this in any
reliable way.  The shape of the curves is very similar though, so
likely Italy can be used as a guide for how deaths will evolve over time for
these countries, whatever the absolute counts end up being.

<LI>The death rate in Belgium appears very high, but Belgium is
including deaths in care homes in the statistics, whereas some other
countries are not.  On April 11th, <a
href="https://epidemio.wiv-isp.be/ID/Pages/2019-nCoV_epidemiological_situation.aspx?lcid=1036">42%
of COVID19 deaths</a> in Belgium were reported to be in care homes.
The Belgian and French data possibly are comparable though, as both
include nursing home deaths.

  A Holt-Winters moving average filter with constants &alpha;=0.5 and

<LI>The number of deaths per day appears to have peaked in Italy and
Spain.

<LI>The number of deaths per day is no longer growing exponentially
anywhere in Western Europe or Scandinavia.  Many countries are seeing
what appears to be the early stages of a reduction in daily deaths.

<LI>Although the number of new confirmed cases per day in Austria has
clearly peaked on March 27th, the number of deaths per day has
been slow to decline.  A similar pattern was seen in South
Korea, where the peak in the death rate was nearly a month after the
peak in the peak in new confirmed cases.

<LI>See the comment on the previous graph regarding the Belgian
numbers, and why the absolute values of these curves are in some
doubt.  However, any measurement differences will be within a factor
of two at most; they will not appear large on a logscale plot, so the
overall shape of the curves is not really in doubt.

<LI>I have removed Sweden from this graph, as the way deaths are
attributed to days makes it impossible to present in this form in a
way that is not misleading.</UL>

<LI>Spain: mostly does not include nursing homes, as only includes confirmed cases, and <a href="https://elpais.com/espana/madrid/2020-04-08/4750-ancianos-mueren-en-las-residencias-de-madrid-en-el-ultimo-mes.html">most nursing home deaths were not tested</a>.

confirmed. Source: private email.

of deaths</a> occurred in nursing homes.

care homes account for 40% of all deaths.

<LI>However they are being reported, if the reporting is consistent
(for example, only reporting hospital deaths) then we can at least
tell how fast deaths are rising or declining.  For this purpose, what
we really need is a fast and consistent count of deaths, even if it

</LI>
<LI>Iceland, Norway and Denmark have all peaked in terms of confirmed
cases, and all three countries have a much lower increase rate of
deaths that Italy did at a similar phase.  It seems highly likely that
the final death tolls for this initial wave will be low in these
countries.

<LI>It is not yet clear if Finland has peaked in terms of confirmed
cases, but Finland has an even lower death toll than the other Nordic
countries and has a low increase rate for deaths.  The number of
deaths increased significantly on April 21st because the Hospital
District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) added disease-related deaths
from nursing homes in the Helsinki metropolitan area.

<LI>Sweden was following the Italian curve for deaths, in common with
most large European countries.  Deaths peaked there on April 8th, and
again on April 15th. The seem to have been declining every since, but
the way the deaths are allocated to days means the most recent week or
so should probably be ignored is it is still in flux.

<LI>Denmark also appears to have passed the peak for deaths about two
weeks ago.  Since then deaths per day have declined from 22 to about 10.</UL>

<LI>Luxembourg is such an outlier in the previous graph that this
leads me to doubt that the confirmed case data is comparable with
other countries.  The number of deaths in Luxembourg is very small -
only 44 as of 8th April - but it's just enough that we can get a very rough
cross-calibration of case data vs death data.  It seems likely that
testing in Luxembourg is much more effective than in France or Italy,
and so is identifying many more people whose symptoms would be too
mild to merit testing in France or Germany.  It is clear that there
are a large number of cases in Luxembourg, but not so many more per
million inhabitants as the previous graph shows.  It looks like deaths
lag case data by about ten days more in Luxembourg than in France.
The German data shows a similar additional lag.

       <LI>I normally use a log scale on the y-axis because
     exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph.
     This allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However,
     many readers don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
     them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
     It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
     except it looks scarier.  

<LI><B>Be careful using this graph for prediction purposes</B>.  Conclusions
you may draw from the trajectory on logscale graphs are much less
sensitive to the fraction of infections being detected than on this
linear graph.  For example, if the UK was detecting 10% of cases and
Spain was detecting 15% of cases, their trajectories would appear
similar on this graph.  On a logscale graph, the gradient is not
affected by constant multiplicative differences in detection rate.</UL>

<LI>Public Health England has changed the way confirmed cases are
reported.  Previously they were reported by the date test results were
available.  Now they are reported by the test sample date, which
removes some artifacts caused by reporting results in batches, but it
means that the results are not stable for several days.  As a result,
I am not showing the results for tests performed less than four days
ago.  By this time, the most of the results are in for tests performed
four or more days ago, though some do still trickle in after this
time.

<LI>All the English regions converged onto the 35% daily increase
curve that Italy followed, then transitioned to the 22% daily increase
curve, though London and the Midlands spent longer at 35% than the
other regions.  Since then, all the regions have seen further reductions.  I have aligned all the regions at the point in which they reached 200 cases per million inhabitants.  This emphasizes recent differences in growth giving a better idea of where things are going, while deemphasizing older increases.

<LI>London is running around a week ahead of the resst of the UK, and is tracking
along the curve that Italy followed.  It looks like the daily increase rate
in London peaked on April 2nd (as measured by samples taken that day).

<LI>North East England and the Midlands also look to have peaked.

Italy followed, then followed the 13.5% curve that Italy also
followed. I have aligned by this 8% curve that Italy followed shortly
before peaking.  In the last three weeks all have experienced
continued declines in the daily percentage increase (though not
declines in the absolute number of new cases), though Wales took
longer to make this transition, so now has a larger number of cases

     <LI> The early part of the China curve is shown for
     comparison. I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are in the
     early stage because they didn't initially know what to look for,
     and the way of measuring changed part way through this period.
     The initial increase rate is fairly consistent with the 35% daily growth seen in
     Europe.

<LI>China and South Korea both had a high sustained increase rate, and
     then brought the virus under control, as seen in the level
     curves.

<LI>The USA tracked very closely along the 35% growth
     line, and did so for much longer than any other
     country. Confirmed cases in the worst affected US states now appear to be peaking.

<LI>Iran tracked a little above a 35% increase rate until four weeks
  ago.  Since then, Iran had experienced ten days of consistent 11.5%
  exponential growth, with the following ten days showing further
  decline.  For many days the daily increase in cases was roughly
  constant at around 1100-1200 new cases per day, but then i
  started to increase exponentially again.
  It is possible the constant phase was due to limitations in testing.  The last two weeks Iran new appears to be getting the epidemic under control again, and case appear to have peaked.

<LI>Japan is has been an enigma for a long time, with an extremely
  consistent 8.5% per day daily growth rate for many weeks, until a
  month ago weeks when it declined further, before rebounding
  significantly two weeks ago.  It seems more likely that early
  measures taken there were effective to some degree at reducing the
  increase rate, but are not sufficient to avoid exponential growth
  altogether.  There is some discussion that the historic figures for
  Japan may not have been accurate, but I won't speculate on this
  other than to note that the Japanese curve has always been an
  unusual outlier.  The last five days show a sudden decrease in new cases.</UL>

  <LI> Showing cases per million inhabitants does not greatly change
  the overall picture compared to the previous graph.

<LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it is better to examine the US on a
  state-by-state basis.

<LI>Singapore contained the initial imported cases very well through
  contact tracing.  However, for the last month Singapore has seen
  progressively higher per day increase rates.  This growth was due in
  part to contact tracing losing its effectiveness, and recently
  Singapore announced more isolation measures as the number of
  untraced cases was rising.  The last few days the increase rate has
  been in the 15-20% range.

On April 22nd, William Hal Martin at NUS explained the situation there to me:

<P><I> The government tried to combine contact tracing, isolation,
travel restrictions, symptom monitoring, public education and
gradually increasing restrictions on public interactions in an effort
to control the outbreak while maintaining some sense of function and
normalcy.  That policy was beginning to lose effectiveness so they
implemented a “Circuit Breaker” on 7 April.  It included strict work
from home policies, business closures, required masks outdoors,
elimination of social gatherings anywhere and fines for
non-compliance.  Just as this was implemented there was a explosion in
the number of cases here.  The new outbreak is limited mainly to the
population of visiting workers who live in close quarters in housing
complexes.  323,000 of the visiting workers live in dormitories.

<P>
The dramatic increase in the number of cases in Singapore is from the localized outbreak within the worker population.

<P> Hundreds of volunteers are assisting medical personnel in the
process of screening as many workers as possible in order to identify,
separate, isolate and/or treat the infected.  The increase in
confirmed cases can also be attributed to that aggressive testing in
these communities.  </I>

<LI>The last few days these measures do seem to have started reduce
the daily new cases from a peak of 1426 on April 20th to 867 or 7%  on April
24th.

<LI>Australia peaked on 28th March and has seen declining numbers of
new cases since then.  It is not quite clear to me why Australia has
been so successful in reducing new cases, as the main measures were
only enacted on March 22nd, which is too late to have accounted for a peak
on March 28th, given incubation time and testing delays.

<LI>South American countries seem to be clustered into two: Andean
states except for Columbia have  tracked roughly along
the 22% daily increase curve, roughly following the track taken by
Italy.  This trend stopped about two weeks ago in most countries.

<LI>New cases in Argentina appear to have peaked on April 2nd,
declined, then peaked again on April 11th.  It is not clear yet whether this will be the final peak.

<LI>New cases in Chile have been fairly constant for two weeks, but
show no sign of declining yet.

<LI>The curves for Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador are all rather noisy.
The Ecuador curve in particular is sufficiently noisy that it casts
doubt on how accurately it is tracking the underlying infections, as
the infection process at this scale is unlikely to be this variable.

<LI>South American countries seem to be clustered into two: Andean
states except for Columbia tracking roughly along the 22% daily
increase curve for some time, roughly following the track taken by
Italy.  The rest of South America seems to be fairing considerably
better, with lower overall numbers of cases and lower increase rates.
Growth is still exponential though.

<LI>The total number of confirmed cases in Venezuela is very small,
with daily increases being in the low single digits.

<LI>The daily increases in Uruguay are also low - in the last week
they have been under ten per day.  The largest daily increase
was 36 cases, on March 27th.  There is a decrease in cumulative cases
on April 12th; before this date, positive tests were reported as
conformed, even though some subsequently re-tested negative.</UL>

<LI>I originally included a graph for Vietnam, Cambodia, Taiwan and
the Philippines, not because the situation there is bad, but because
the trend for each had started to look worrying.  Since then all these
countries have peaked, and the situation appears to be in control.

<LI>Philippines peaked on March 31st, with 538 cases that day, but has
declined since to around 25% of that level.

<LI>Vietnam and Cambodia have very low counts of new confirmed cases -
around one a day in Cambodia, and low single digits in Vietnam. It
seems likely that these rates are in part due to hot humid weather.

<LI>The graph shows <B>cumulative number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a log
scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the
amounts shown. </LI>
  <LI>Most warm countries do not have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  

<LI>India, Indonesia and Egypt are all warm countries and have all
    were experiencing roughly 14% daily growth.  The last few days
    Egypt and Indonesia have seen a significant decline in growth
    rate, and Egypt may be peaking, though we won't have confidence in
    this for a few more days.

<LI>Australia was on the 14% curve, but then switched to the 22%
  curve.  This appeared to correspond to temperatures reducing, but
  more analysis would be needed to know if this is significant.  Since
  then, Australia's daily confirmed case count <a
  href="#rates-peaked">has peaked</a>, then declined significantly.

<LI>Malaysia had been tracking close to 14%, but has not seen
exponential growth since March 16th.  Malaysia peaked either on March
26th or April 3rd (the two peaks are similar), but declines since have
been slow and it is possible another peak may still occur.

<LI>Brazil was tracking roughly along the 35% line for a while, which
seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the
virus, but recently it has moved to lower growth.  I have now aligned
Brazil with the 14% curve experience by other warm countries, and
Brazil has roughly followed this track for nearly three weeks.  Brazil
actually has both tropical and equatorial climate zones, so it unclear
how this should manifest in COVID-19 progression.

<LI> Bahrain and Kuwait have very low recent increase levels. This
  may indicate that most cases were imports, and that local spread has
  been effectively contained.

<LI>Qatar previously was following the same curve as Bahrain, but the
last week has increased suddenly to match the 14% daily increase rate
of Brazil.

<LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have omitted it from this
  graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
  climate-dependent effect we might observe.

<LI>Vietnam and Cambodia are shown on <a
href="#covid-world-seasia">this graph</a>; both have warm humid
climates and very low recent growth.

<LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in
  warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, and it appears to
  require relatively hot temperatures to have much effect.

<LI>The graph shows <b>number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a
linear scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset
by the amounts shown.</LI>

 <LI>In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph,
    and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows
    exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many readers
    have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
    them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
    It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to
    get if effective measures are not taken.

<LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate drops
    below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a change in
    measurement methodology.

<LI>Italy and France closely followed the Chinese curve during the exponential period, but both have taken longer to bring the epidemic under control. Both countries have peaked, but the decline is significantly slower than it was in China.

<LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident. 
   
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran, and its subsequent reduction.  It is unclear to me
  whether exponential growth actually had previously stopped in Iran,
  or whether the increase rate was simply limited by their testing
  capacity.  If it was the latter, then something about their process
  for confirming cases has changed.  New cases in Iran peaked on March 30th.

<LI>I have added Austria to this graph, as it is a western country
that has clearly peaked, showing almost as quick a decline in new cases as South Korea.

using
the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">WHO

<P><B>Q: Can I have your data?</B>
  <P>My data is <a href="https://github.com/mhandley/COVID19/">on github</a>.
  <P>A more complete dataset is the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins</a> one. It tends to lag the national data sources and the WHO, but it is complete and machine readable.

  <P><B>Q: Can I use your graphs?</B>
  <P>
    Yes, they're under a CC0 "No rights reserved" license.  You can
    use them for any purpose.  I'd prefer you link back here though,
    as the explanations add important context.

  <P><B>Q: Different countries are testing at different rates.  How can you compare the data?</B>
    <P>So long as the fraction of actual cases being detected does
    not change, this does not affect any inference we can make about
    the growth rate.  35% growth is still 35% growth, whether we
    measure 100% of the cases or 50%.
    <P>If, for example, Italy is detecting 50% of the cases and the
    US is detecting 25% of cases, this affects any predictions of how
    far the US is behind Italy At 35% growth, cases double every 2.5
    days, so this undersampling would show the US 2.5 days further
    behind than it really is.
    <P>Likely no-one except Korea and Singapore are getting close to
    100% of cases.  Probably everyone is detecting at least 20% of
    cases, because those require medical attention.  We don't really
    know what fraction of cases are missed, but the difference in
    sampling between countries might skew the delays by a few days in
      either direction.

  <P><B>Q: Comparing with Italy as a whole is flawed. Shouldn't you be comparing with Lombardy?</B>
    <P>Perhaps.  Certainly cases in Italy are concentrated in the
    North at the moment.  Lombardy is running about seven days ahead
    of the rest of the country, as measured by cases per million
    inhabitants. I've shown this in <a href="#g3">graph 3</a>. The
    problem is that cases in some other countries, notably France,
    Spain and the USA, are also concentrated, so comparing these
    entire countries with Lombardy is biased in the other direction.
    These graphs give a crude indication, but they're never going to
    be able to track problems down to the local level, where an
    individual town is overwhelmed by cases before this becomes
    commonplace in a country.  Just remember, to compare with
    Lombardy, a rough approximation is to move the Italy curve seven days
    to the right.
    <P><B>Q: Shouldn't you break out China by province?</B>
    <P> At the moment I'm only showing China on the graphs that show
    absolute counts, not counts per million inhabitants.  As the vast
    majority of Chinese cases were in Hubei, there's not a great deal
    of difference on these graphs between showing Hubei and showing
    all of China.  The population of Hubei province is around 57
    million, which is roughly the same as Italy.  Thus the data for
    China is reasonably comparable with the data for Italy.
<P>
   The Chinese data is somewhat suspect in the early days, so it's not
   very good for comparison until the epidemic gets a fair way along.
   Mostly I'm using Italy to provide a model for how other places
   might progress, as it's a better fit.  But as of March 16th, I've
   changed the last (linear) graph to use the Chinese data to show one
   possible direction that Italy might follow.
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, cases that arose were stamped on quickly, and
   pretty much all of China shut down until that was complete.  In
   Europe we failed to learn from that model, so we're all much
   further along than Beijing, Shanghai, or similar provinces ever
   got.
      
  <P><B>Q: Why didn't you show my country?</B>
    <P>A1. Until the number of cases reaches around 100, the data
    tends to be too noisy to draw conclusions
    <P>A2. The graphs are pretty cluttered as it is.  
    <P>A3. I'll add more as I find time.

  <P><B>Q: You aren't an epidemiologist. Why should I listen to you?</B>
    <P>You probably shouldn't.  I'm a computer scientist and I've
    spend decades analysing data, but you should talk to a real
    epidemiologist if you want to understand the underlying causes.
    Computer scientists do know a lot about exponential growth though.
  <P><B>Q: I'm a journalist.  Will you appear on my TV show?</B>
    <P>No. You should have a real epidemiologist on your TV show.
