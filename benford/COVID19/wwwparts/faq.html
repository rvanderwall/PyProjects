<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<P>
    While you're sitting pondering your mortality, think how astounding it is that one single viral particle from a bat can replicate so far, so fast, and cause so much trouble!  Biology is truly amazing!

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<P><B>Q: Where does the data come from?</B>
<P>Where possible, the data comes from the relevant national
authorities, as they tend to be more up to date.  In some cases I'm
using
the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">WHO
daily briefing</a>, but they lag the national authorities somewhat.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">wikipedia
pages</a> contain links to the national authorities.  Some are

<P><B>Q: Can I have your data?</B>
  <P>My data is <a href="https://github.com/mhandley/COVID19/">on github</a>.
  <P>A more complete dataset is the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins</a> one. It tends to lag the national data sources and the WHO, but it is complete and machine readable.

  <P><B>Q: Can I use your graphs?</B>
  <P>
    Yes, they're under a CC0 "No rights reserved" license.  You can
    use them for any purpose.  I'd prefer you link back here though,
    as the explanations add important context.

  <P><B>Q: Different countries are testing at different rates.  How can you compare the data?</B>
    <P>So long as the fraction of actual cases being detected does
    not change, this does not affect any inference we can make about
    the growth rate.  35% growth is still 35% growth, whether we
    measure 100% of the cases or 50%.
    <P>If, for example, Italy is detecting 50% of the cases and the
    US is detecting 25% of cases, this affects any predictions of how
    far the US is behind Italy At 35% growth, cases double every 2.5
    days, so this undersampling would show the US 2.5 days further
    behind than it really is.
    <P>Likely no-one except Korea and Singapore are getting close to
    100% of cases.  Probably everyone is detecting at least 20% of
    cases, because those require medical attention.  We don't really
    know what fraction of cases are missed, but the difference in
    sampling between countries might skew the delays by a few days in
      either direction.

  <P><B>Q: Comparing with Italy as a whole is flawed. Shouldn't you be comparing with Lombardy?</B>
    <P>Perhaps.  Certainly cases in Italy are concentrated in the
    North at the moment.  Lombardy is running about seven days ahead
    of the rest of the country, as measured by cases per million
    inhabitants. I've shown this in <a href="#g3">graph 3</a>. The
    problem is that cases in some other countries, notably France,
    Spain and the USA, are also concentrated, so comparing these
    entire countries with Lombardy is biased in the other direction.
    These graphs give a crude indication, but they're never going to
    be able to track problems down to the local level, where an
    individual town is overwhelmed by cases before this becomes
    commonplace in a country.  Just remember, to compare with
    Lombardy, a rough approximation is to move the Italy curve seven days
    to the right.
    <P><B>Q: Shouldn't you break out China by province?</B>
    <P> At the moment I'm only showing China on the graphs that show
    absolute counts, not counts per million inhabitants.  As the vast
    majority of Chinese cases were in Hubei, there's not a great deal
    of difference on these graphs between showing Hubei and showing
    all of China.  The population of Hubei province is around 57
    million, which is roughly the same as Italy.  Thus the data for
    China is reasonably comparable with the data for Italy.
<P>
   The Chinese data is somewhat suspect in the early days, so it's not
   very good for comparison until the epidemic gets a fair way along.
   Mostly I'm using Italy to provide a model for how other places
   might progress, as it's a better fit.  But as of March 16th, I've
   changed the last (linear) graph to use the Chinese data to show one
   possible direction that Italy might follow.
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, cases that arose were stamped on quickly, and
   pretty much all of China shut down until that was complete.  In
   Europe we failed to learn from that model, so we're all much
   further along than Beijing, Shanghai, or similar provinces ever
   got.
      
  <P><B>Q: Why didn't you show my country?</B>
    <P>A1. Until the number of cases reaches around 100, the data
    tends to be too noisy to draw conclusions
    <P>A2. The graphs are pretty cluttered as it is.  
    <P>A3. I'll add more as I find time.

  <P><B>Q: You aren't an epidemiologist. Why should I listen to you?</B>
    <P>You probably shouldn't.  I'm a computer scientist and I've
    spend decades analysing data, but you should talk to a real
    epidemiologist if you want to understand the underlying causes.
    Computer scientists do know a lot about exponential growth though.
  <P><B>Q: I'm a journalist.  Will you appear on my TV show?</B>
    <P>No. You should have a real epidemiologist on your TV show.
