<font color="red">Updated: 25th April 2020, 03:07 BST <B>All graphs
    have been updated, but only some of the commentary. I've added
    graphs comparing the death rate in the North East US region to EU
    countries.

<P>In general, many countries are showing signs of having peaked
(number of new confirmed cases per day is now decreasing), and several
are now showing signs that the death rate has also peaked. The path down from the peak is often not smooth and a number of countries have seen case numbers rebound one of more times after the peak.  MJH</B></font>
