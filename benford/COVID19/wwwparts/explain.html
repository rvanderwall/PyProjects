<P>
This page presents historical SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
information.  I try to present it in a way that helps inform about how
the virus is progressing throughout the main outbreaks worldwide in a
way that allows countries to be compared and perhaps lessons learned.
The underlying infection and containment processes are complicated,
and conclusions you or I may draw from these graphs are not true
predictions.  For that, you'd need much more data about what is being
done in each country, and about how the data is collected. Comments
are my interpretation only.  Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.
